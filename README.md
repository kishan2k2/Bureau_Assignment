## Next optimisations and plans to do.

I had removed and replaced all the categorical values with pca componenets.

Now I will add some of categrorical columns back, which has binary or tertiary values.

I experiment with imputation cause they are very much in high amount so I want to see what effects will be there when I remove those columns and all.

Take conclusions from all of those plots and all.

Report and all, make sure to do it the correct way.

Making of the report.
