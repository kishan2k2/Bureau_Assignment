# Bureau_Assignment


## Next optimisations and plans to do.

Output should be categorial values and not binary values change that.

I had removed and replaced all the categorical values with pca componenets.

Now I will add some of categrorical columns back, which has binary or tertiary values.

I experiment with imputation cause they are very much in high amount so I want to see what effects will be there when I remove those columns and all Decide carefully on what to turn back and what not to well if any feature is great I will include it back.

Make sure to clean the code. With titles and all.

Make sure to have requirements.txt to cause no probelm at all.

Include the collab notebook files and all.

Take conclusions from all of those plots and all. Do include those.

Report and all, make sure to do it the correct way.

Making of the report.
